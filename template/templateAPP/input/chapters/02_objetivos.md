# Objectives.

We aim to create a way to analyze the human body that is more accessible for everyone so we can improve the lives of people who may not have easy access to doctors or specialists. The goal of this project is to make the world a better place using the technology of the future that we are starting to develop now.
The project will start small by introducing a back problem as a means to develop the data model that will later be used for several other illnesses and even try to detect some non-physical problems using behavioral and movement-based analysis.

We don't want to substitute the medical professionals, that would be very irresponsible as peoples' lives may be at risk. This project aims to provide those professionals the tools to better do their job, to assess the patients beforehand and to have a better reach of patients who cannot access doctors due to physical restrictions.




## Data obtenction via RGB camera and data validation.

We are going to consider the different types of cameras to be used to process the data, these cameras have different capabilities and characteristics. We are going to analyze the differences between them and we are going to see how we can make use of their data.
In our case, we are going to use RGB cameras, which do not have depth perception by themselves, so we have to investigate how to transcribe depth to them.
Not only is the camera we use relevant, but the software used to process what is seen by the camera is also relevant. Therefore we are going to investigate the different ways of data capture and processing.

In contrast to other types of cameras our choice, the RGB camera, is not a camera with previous scientific validation. This is why we have to investigate how the validation process of the camera and the data we obtain from it can be done. The data need to be validated not only scientifically, but also in terms of what parameters are going to be useful for the data model.

The aim of this is to help the medical field by setting a base for future development of medical applications using this type of camera, which will be very beneficial as it is the most common and and the most accessible for everyone. We think that if we come to conclusions and create a successful data model, the rgb camera will be able to be used in future research by other teams and developers. 
This is the reason why data validation is crucial for our project. It is not only necessary for the data model but also for the future of the medical field relating to the use of common-day smartphones for medical applications.

## AI model training.

The data that we acquire from the cameras must be processed before being used for the data model and training. Also, this will help us determine what data is useful for future deployment of applications so the load on the devices is not as hard.
With this, we aim to create a model that will be slim and powerful as it will have only the data that we require at a certain point in time. This will allow our project to be used by everyone and everywhere as part of our aim to expand the possibilities of helping people.

AI models are not that new anymore, which means that there are a lot of methods and services that help you train data models, we are going to dive into the different aspects of ones and others that have different characteristics between them. One may be more useful than others for our task.
That also includes different methods of hosting these AI models and the research of different diseases to best choose the one that fits us the most and can be most of an improvement.

One big part of this project is also the image recognition software that we will be using, our objective is, as we mentioned, to use RGB cameras and therefore we need an image recognition software that translates the data into 3d from a 2d capture.

## Validation of the diagnostic system for the pathology of the initial case study.

With this all in mind, we want to create more than one AI model in the future using the research we have done on the way. These other AI models would be trained for different pathologies of the human body and possibly the mind. 

But before we can do that, we have another objective to reach, which is getting validation for our project from the medical field, as we are not doctors ourselves. 
This validation is key as it will serve as a precedent, as we have talked about before. The precedent is very important for the camera, the software and future models that we train, as would be backed by previous research and success.
