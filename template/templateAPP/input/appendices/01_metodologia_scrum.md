# Anexo 1 - Metodologia de trabajo Scrum

Scrum is an agile project management framework that helps teams deliver high-value products. It emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and customer feedback. The process is organized into time-boxed iterations called sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks. Scrum includes roles like Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team, as well as specific events like Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.

This is an altered version of the scrum methodology since there are only two parties involved in this project, the developer and the product owner. Carlos will be the developer and Felix and David will take part as the product owners.
When adapting Scrum for a single developer and a single Product Owner, the structure can be simplified while maintaining key principles. 
Here's the modified version we are opting for:
- Roles:
  - Developer: This is the individual responsible for all aspects of the product's development, from design to implementation and testing. Carlos Rincón González
  - Product Owner (PO): This person represents the stakeholders, defines the features, and prioritizes the work to maximize the product's value. Felix Albertos and David Carneros
- Events:
  - Sprint Planning: At the beginning of each sprint (a development iteration), the developer and PO collaborate to plan the work for the upcoming sprint. These events will occur once every 2 to 4 weeks during the sprint meeting.
  - Daily Check-in: The developer has a brief daily check-in to review progress and plan the next steps. This is an opportunity to adjust plans based on feedback or changing priorities. This is not a necessary step and it's mostly used as a method of self-organization in the daily tasks of the developer
  - Sprint Review: At the end of each sprint, the developer presents the completed work to the PO. They discuss what was achieved and any adjustments needed for future sprints. Same as with the sprint planning, this will take part as part of the sprint meeting.
  - Sprint Retrospective: The developer reflects on the sprint, identifying what went well and what could be improved. This can be a brief self-assessment to enhance the development process. This will be a part of the sprint meeting as well.

- Artifacts:
  - Backlog: The Product Owner maintains a prioritized list of features and tasks, known as the backlog. The developer pulls items from the top of the backlog into each sprint.
  - The initial product backlog will consist of all the objectives set for the project in the beginning meeting. This objective will be stripped down into its crucial and more basic parts to be worked on and to develop a successful project

By simplifying the structure, a single developer can still benefit from Scrum's iterative and feedback-driven approach. The collaboration between the developer and product owner remains crucial for delivering valuable increments of the product.

For the management and monitoring of the project, we will make use of a tool called GitHubFor this workflow, we are going to use the tool within GitHub called Github projects. GitHub Projects is a collaborative project management tool designed to enhance the organization and tracking of software development projects on the GitHub platform. It provides a visual interface that allows teams to plan, track, and manage their work efficiently. GitHub Projects utilizes the concept of boards, where tasks are represented as cards that can be moved between customizable columns, such as "Product Backlog", "Sprint Backlog", "In Progress", and "Done". This flexibility makes it adaptable to various project management methodologies, including Agile and Kanban. 
Additionally, GitHub Projects integrates seamlessly with other GitHub features, such as code repositories and pull requests, providing a comprehensive ecosystem for collaborative software development, which is precisely the reason why we chose to use it, as we hosted our project on GitHub.

## Sprint 1 (20/09/2023 - 04/10/2023) - First Meeting

- **Sprint meeting**
  - We stablish the bases of the project and the work methodology, and also we stablish a final name and theme.
- **Sprint Tasks**
  - Define the basics of the methodology and decide on an interface and a form to apply it
  - Create the GitHub project and create the product backlog

## Sprint 2 (04/10/2023 - 22/11/2023) Project definition and configuration

- **Sprint meeting**
  - Defining the project objectives and bullet points

- **Sprint Tasks**
  - Define and finalize the objectives of the project **(3)**
  - Create the constitution project document. **(2)**
  - Creation of the project based on Felix's template **(1)**

- **Sprint Retrospective**
  - The template works properly and has been filled
  - The project objectives seem clear and well-defined

## Sprint 3 (22/11/2023 - 05/12/2023) - Introduction.

- **Sprint meeting**
  - We start discussions about the project information itself and how to make the project´s memory.
  - We decided to start developing the introduction of the project so it is useful as a stepping stone for the rest of the project.
 
- **Sprint Tasks**
  - Research on back pain-related problems. **(4)**
  - How mental issues affect and relate to posture. **(3)**
  - How technology improves the medical field **(3)**

- **Sprint Retrospective**
  - The Introduction has started successfully but will need more work in the future.
  - The introduction may be split into different sections in the future as it may need more work

## Sprint 4 (05/12/2023  - 19/12/2023 )  - State of the art.

- **Sprint meeting**
  - We agreed that the introduction art needed more development and we set ourselves on the path to research more about it in the future.
  - At this point, it was time to start working on the state of the art.
  - Also, we had to stablish the motivations and objectives more clearly and develop a clear explanation of them in the project memory.

- **Sprint Tasks**
  - Further explanation of the introduction **(1)**
  - Research of the state of the art **(9)**
    - Types of cameras **(4)**
    - Tracking methodology **(3)**
    - Mediapipe definition **(2)**

- **Sprint Retrospective**
  - **Aqui voy a poner lo que hablemos este sprint**

## Sprint template ( 19/12/2023 - 16/01/2024 )  - Holiday Season Improvements 

- **Sprint meeting**
  - The previous sprint was successful in creating a beginning of a state of the art.
  - this sprint will take part during the holiday season and therefore will be lighter
  - we will use this time to further improve the work on the last sprints by improving the introduction and the state of the art research.

- **Sprint Tasks**
  - Research on the introduction (3)
  - Research on the state of the art (3)
  - Write compelling explanations and deeper knowledge (4)
  
- **Sprint Retrospective**
