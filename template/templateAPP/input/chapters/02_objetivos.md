## O1: Data obenction via RGB camera

We are going to consider the different types of cameras to be used to process the data, these cameras have different capabilities and characteristics. We are going to analyze the differences between them and we are going to see the way in which we can make use of their data.

In our case we are going to use RGB cameras, which do not have depth perception by themselves, so we have to investigate how to transcribe depth to them.

Not only is the camera we use relevant, but the software used to process what is seen by the camera is also relevant. Therefore we are going to investigate the different ways of data capture and processing.

## O2: Validation of the data acquisition system for motion analysis in a clinical setting

In contrast to other types of cameras our choice, the RGB camera, is not a camera with previous scientific validation. This is why we have to investigate how the validation process of the camera and the data we obtain from it can be done.

The data need to be validated not only scientifically, but also in terms of what parameters are going to be useful for the data model.

## O3: Definition of the data to be used and their generalization for AI model training.

The data that we aquire from the cameras must be processed before being used for the data model and training. Also this will help us determine what data is useful for future deployment of aplications so the load on the devices is not as hard.

## O4: Comparison of different methods for training AI models for the diagnosis of the pathology of the initial case study

AI models are not that new anymore, that means that there are a lot of methods and services that help you train data models, we are going to dive on the diferent aspects of ones and others that have diferent caracteristics between them. Ones may be more useful than others for our task.

That also includes diferent methods of hosting these AI models and the research of diferent diseases to best choose the one that fits us the most and can be most of an improvement.

## O5: Development of a tool for training AI models for the initial case study

We not only aim to research everything in this field, we are going to develop a data model that fits our needs and gives us our desired outcome.

## O6: Validation of the diagnostic system for the pathology of the initial case study.
