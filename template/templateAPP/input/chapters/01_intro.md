### How back pain affects health
Health is a problem that never can escape us, whether we want it or not, we get sick from time to time, and illnesses are a main cause of discomfort in your day-to-day life, but for many people, it's not only a discomfort, many people have chronic ilneses that don't allow them to have a normal life, and they don't deserve it. As many experts see it two main causes of illness affect people in today's world, mental illness and back pain.

As Gordon Waddell talks about in his book "The back pain revolution", back pain is a pervasive and often debilitating condition that affects millions of people worldwide, transcending age, occupation, and lifestyle. As one of the most common reasons for seeking medical attention, back pain poses a significant challenge to the well-being and functionality of individuals across diverse demographics. This book delves into the multifaceted nature of back pain, exploring its possible causes, far-reaching implications, and the profound impact it has on the daily lives of those who grapple with this condition.

Understanding the root causes of back pain is crucial in addressing and managing this prevalent health issue. From musculoskeletal imbalances and poor posture to more complex conditions such as herniated discs and spinal deformities, the variety of factors contributing to back pain is vast. By unraveling these causes, we can better comprehend the intricate web of influences that contribute to the development and persistence of back pain, thereby paving the way for more targeted and effective interventions.

Beyond the physical discomfort it causes, back pain goes through various aspects of individuals' lives. It enters professional life, limiting work productivity and potentially limiting career advancement. Simple daily activities become annoying tasks, demolishing the quality of life for those fighting with persistent pain. Furthermore, the emotional toll of chronic back pain can lead to anxiety, depression, and a sense of helplessness, creating a cascading effect on mental well-being.

Posture stands as a cornerstone in the intricate puzzle of back pain. Poor posture places undue stress on the spine, its supporting structures, and surrounding muscles, often leading to discomfort and pain. Sedentary lifestyles, prolonged hours spent hunched over screens, or improper ergonomics contribute to the prevalence of poor posture. This misalignment, whether subtle or pronounced, can over time lead to imbalances in muscle strength and flexibility, setting the stage for chronic back issues.

The way individuals walk, known as *gait*, is another pivotal factor influencing back health. An abnormal gait pattern can trigger misalignments in the spine, impacting the distribution of forces throughout the body. For instance, an uneven gait or excessive pronation of the feet can lead to compensatory movements in the spine, potentially causing strain and pain.

Occupational demands and lifestyle choices significantly contribute to poor posture and walking habits. Jobs that require prolonged sitting or repetitive movements may contribute to muscular imbalances and faulty posture. Similarly, carrying heavy loads, whether at work or in daily activities, can strain the back and alter gait patterns, further increasing the risk of developing or exacerbating back pain.

This project will explore not only the physiological aspects of back pain but also its broader implications on society. By researching this condition, we aim to help the development of comprehensive strategies for prevention, management, and treatment. Through an understanding and research of back pain, we can empower individuals, healthcare professionals, and policymakers to collaborate in mitigating its impact and creating a healthier, more resilient society.

### Improving the medical field
In today's world health and its studies have improved a lot. Nevertheless, the improvement must never stop, and helping this improvement is part of us as programmers and technicians. This improvement can often come as a part of studies and research on new technologies and innovations on old ones, and also it can come as the development of the structure behind the system itself. 

The field of computer science is ever-developing, and new technologies emerge every day giving us opportunities to make the world a better place. The new hotness is Artificial intelligence, and we think we can use it to develop new tools that can help us. In this case, we are using a type of artificial intelligence that 

In this project we aim to tackle both fronts, we aim to develop a system that can help us recognize patterns in illnesses so they help specialists with their work, and also we want to create a tool for them to use so the system is less cluttered and
