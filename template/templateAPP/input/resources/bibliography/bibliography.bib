    abstract = "{Disabling low back pain in industrialized societies has become the focus of wide‐ranging research over the last 15 yr. The importance of its social and financial impact is not reflected in the current UK health provision agenda. The economic impact of days lost from work, invalidity benefit and health service utilization as a result of chronic back pain is enormous, having risen rapidly since the mid 1970s [1]. Benefit payments have plateaued in the last 3 yr [2]. The cause is unclear, but may be due to the ‘All work’ test and the use of acute back pain guidelines.The 1‐month prevalence of low back pain is 35–37\\%, with a slightly higher female prevalence. Lifetime prevalence is estimated at 59\\%, with peak prevalence between 45 and 59 yr of age [3]. Around 10\\% of back pain episodes lead to consultation with a general practitioner, and 90\\% of patients have improved at 1 month [4]. Although patients stop seeking care, the majority continue to be symptomatic at 1 yr, with only 21 and 25\\% completely recovered with reference to pain and disability respectively. This suggests a chronic fluctuating symptom course with intermittent flares [5].}",

abstract = {Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in medicine is the result of a large amount of effort expended in the interface of medicine and computer science. As some CAD systems in medicine try to emulate the diagnostic decision-making process of medical experts, they can be considered as expert systems in medicine. Furthermore, CAD systems in medicine may process clinical data that can be complex and/or massive in size. They do so in order to infer new knowledge from data and use that knowledge to improve their diagnostic performance over time. Therefore, such systems can also be viewed as intelligent systems because they use a feedback mechanism to improve their performance over time. The main aim of the literature survey described in this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of past and current CAD developments. This survey/review can be of significant value to researchers and professionals in medicine and computer science. There are already some reviews about specific aspects of CAD in medicine. However, this paper focuses on the entire spectrum of the capabilities of CAD systems in medicine. It also identifies the key developments that have led to today's state-of-the-art in this area. It presents an extensive and systematic literature review of CAD in medicine, based on 251 carefully selected publications. While medicine and computer science have advanced dramatically in recent years, each area has also become profoundly more complex. This paper advocates that in order to further develop and improve CAD, it is required to have well-coordinated work among researchers and professionals in these two constituent fields. Finally, this survey helps to highlight areas where there are opportunities to make significant new contributions. This may profoundly impact future research in medicine and in select areas of computer science.}
