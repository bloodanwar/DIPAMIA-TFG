# Introduction.

When we were first discussing the possible themes of this project, we encountered papers that talked about the possible relation between depression and movement or posture. These studies were made using the Kinect as a tool to recognize the patterns of the movement of the afflicted people @Yu2022Jun @Seifallahi2022 . This in conjunction with the sudden growth of the AI field at the moment sparked the idea that we could contribute to this field and make some development of our own. But before we get to depression there are many other problems that we could also address, one of which is very important to me as a person, back pain.

## How back pain affects health.
Health is a problem that never can escape us, whether we want it or not, we get sick from time to time, and illnesses are a main cause of discomfort in your day-to-day life, but for many people, it's not only a discomfort, many people have chronic illnesses that don't allow them to have a normal life, and they don't deserve it. As many experts see it two main causes of illness affect people in today's world, mental illness and back pain.

As Gordon Waddell talks about in his book "The back pain revolution", back pain is a pervasive and often debilitating condition that affects millions of people worldwide, transcending age, occupation, and lifestyle. As one of the most common reasons for seeking medical attention, back pain poses a significant challenge to the well-being and functionality of individuals across diverse demographics. This book delves into the multifaceted nature of back pain, exploring its possible causes, far-reaching implications, and the profound impact it has on the daily lives of those who grapple with this condition.

Understanding the root causes of back pain is crucial in addressing and managing this prevalent health issue. From musculoskeletal imbalances and poor posture to more complex conditions such as herniated discs and spinal deformities, the variety of factors contributing to back pain is vast. By unraveling these causes, we can better comprehend the intricate web of influences that contribute to the development and persistence of back pain, thereby paving the way for more targeted and effective interventions.

Beyond the physical discomfort it causes, back pain goes through various aspects of individuals' lives. It enters professional life, limiting work productivity and potentially limiting career advancement. Simple daily activities become annoying tasks, demolishing the quality of life for those fighting with persistent pain. Furthermore, the emotional toll of chronic back pain can lead to anxiety, depression, and a sense of helplessness, creating a cascading effect on mental well-being.

Posture stands as a cornerstone in the intricate puzzle of back pain. Poor posture places undue stress on the spine, its supporting structures, and surrounding muscles, often leading to discomfort and pain. Sedentary lifestyles, prolonged hours spent hunched over screens, or improper ergonomics contribute to the prevalence of poor posture. This misalignment, whether subtle or pronounced, can over time lead to imbalances in muscle strength and flexibility, setting the stage for chronic back issues.

The way individuals walk, known as *gait*, is another pivotal factor influencing back health. An abnormal gait pattern can trigger misalignments in the spine, impacting the distribution of forces throughout the body. For instance, an uneven gait or excessive pronation of the feet can lead to compensatory movements in the spine, potentially causing strain and pain, this is a very well-known problem for those who have plain feet and the reason those people need to have prosthetics to help their posture.

Occupational demands and lifestyle choices significantly contribute to poor posture and walking habits. Jobs that require prolonged sitting or repetitive movements may contribute to muscular imbalances and faulty posture. Similarly, carrying heavy loads, whether at work or in daily activities, can strain the back and alter gait patterns, further increasing the risk of developing or exacerbating back pain.

This project will explore not only the physiological aspects of back pain but also its broader implications on society. By researching this condition, we aim to help the development of comprehensive strategies for prevention, management, and treatment. Through an understanding and research of back pain, we can empower individuals, healthcare professionals, and policymakers to collaborate in mitigating its impact and creating a healthier, more resilient society.

## Mental issues and how they relate to posture.

This project will take part in a bigger research article related also to the importance of mental illness in society.

Mental illness poses a significant challenge to society, affecting people, families, and communities on various levels. Moreover, mental illness can disrupt social relationships and hinder effective communication, leading to social isolation and the destruction of a person's life from within itself. Depression, a common mental health disorder, affects millions of people globally, impairing their ability to function optimally in daily life. The repercussions of depression extend beyond individual suffering, where it can lead to harder and much worse consequences. Even if it doesn't go too far it can hinder your life in a very hard way making you not be a "proper" person even limiting you to a bed, as you don't have the strength to leave.

Alzheimer's disease, a form of dementia, is a particularly prevalent and devastating mental health condition. As populations age worldwide, the incidence of Alzheimer's continues to rise, placing immense emotional and financial strain on families. The progressive nature of the disease not only steals the cognitive abilities of the people who suffer it but also places a burden on the families and whoever is in charge of them. Personally, this has been a big issue in my family, where I've suffered several cases of Alzheimer's disease and it's been hard for us as a family to deal with.

The societal impact of mental illness also manifests in stigmatization, discrimination, and inadequate access to mental health services. The stigma surrounding mental health issues can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, increasing the severity of conditions. Addressing mental health challenges on a societal level requires comprehensive strategies, including destigmatization, improved access to mental health resources, and increased awareness to create a supportive and inclusive environment for those affected by these conditions. Addressing mental health not only benefits individuals but also contributes to the overall well-being and productivity of society.

In the research this project takes part in, we aim to also establish a link between posture and movement to the discovery and prevention of mental health such as both we talked about, Alzheimer's and depression. Some articles correlate mental health symptoms to verbal but also non-verbal signs. Researchers have focused their attention on visual and linguistic indications for assessing depression. This project introduces related work on facial features, audio features, body features, and Kinect-based rehabilitation training and detection methods in particular.

## Improving the medical field.

Technology, particularly advancements in computer science, has played a crucial role in revolutionizing the medical field, enhancing patient care, and driving improvements in the healthcare system. One of the most notable contributions comes from the utilization of electronic health records, which have simplified the management and accessibility of patient information. EHRs enable doctors to access detailed and up-to-date patient records instantly, facilitating more informed decision-making and coordinated care across various medical departments. This not only improves efficiency but also reduces medical errors which leads to a better healthcare system overall.

Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications have significantly impacted medical diagnostics and treatment planning. Advanced algorithms can analyze vast amounts of medical data, such as imaging studies, genetic information, and patient histories, to identify patterns and provide decisions that may escape the human eye. In fields like radiology, AI algorithms have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in detecting abnormalities, expediting diagnoses, and contributing to earlier interventions. Additionally, personalized medicine has gained momentum through genomic research, leveraging computational methods to analyze individual genetic profiles and create treatment plans for the specific genetic makeup of each patient.

Telemedicine, another technological advancement fueled by computer science, has transformed healthcare accessibility. Using video consultations, remote monitoring, and digital communication, patients can receive medical advice and monitoring without the need for physical visits to hospitals. This has proven particularly important as of late, following the events of the global pandemic that hit us a couple of years ago, even tho other parts of the world had been using it before that. 

This project aims to tackle the previous points and merge them into one, allowing us the benefits of telemedicine and artificial intelligence to create a new diagnostic method for the biggest health issues of today's world. This is the goal, helping society to overcome what we see as the problems of the future and the present, that make life worse for so many people in this world.
