# State of the art

To know what can be done regarding our interests, we must look at what has already been done so far, so we don't waste our time doing something already done by someone else and also so we can use that research as a base to further improve our understanding and our work. 
Because of this we are going to be looking at the state of the art on camera tecnologies, methods of stracting the data and different models of artificial intelligence.

## Cameras

RGB cameras, short for Red, Green, and Blue cameras, are imaging devices that capture color information by utilizing three primary color chanels: red, green, and blue. These cameras mimic the way human vision percives color by combining these three channels in varying intensities to produce a wide spectrum of colors. Each pixel in the image sensor of an RGB camera contains three sub-pixels, each sensitive to one of the three primary colors. The combination of these sub-pixels allows the camera to capture and reproduce a full range of colors, making RGB cameras essential for applications where color fidelity is crucial.

The popularization of RGB cameras can be attributed to their widespread use in various fields. In consumer electronics, RGB cameras are a key component of smartphones, digital cameras, and webcams, enabling users to capture high quality and realistic images. In the field of entertainment, RGB cameras play a key role in film and television production, making accurate color representation for a more immersive viewing experience. Even more so, RGB cameras are extensively employed in computer vision applications, such as facial recognition, object detection, and augmented reality, where precise color information is vital for accurate analysis and interpretation. This is the field we are going to be using them in, but as we will see, there are more complications to be dealt with when using RGB cameras in the medical field.

RGB cameras have become necessary in modern society, finding applications in industries ranging from healthcare and automotive to agriculture and surveillance. Their ability to faithfully capture and reproduce color has made them indispensable tools in a wide array of technological advancements, contributing significantly to the way we perceive and interact with the visual world. This is the precise reason we chose to evolve on this type of tecnology, to make our outcome, the aplication that relies on the data model, the most accesible posible to all the posible public of our aplication.

- Infrared (IR) Cameras: Capture infrared light, which is beyond the visible spectrum. Used in night vision applications, thermal imaging, and scientific research.
- Ultraviolet (UV) Cameras: Detect ultraviolet light, which is also outside the visible spectrum. Applied in scientific research, forensics, and some industrial processes.
- Multispectral Cameras: Capture light in multiple bands across the electromagnetic spectrum. Useful in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and medical imaging.
- Thermal Infrared Cameras: Detect the heat emitted by objects. Commonly used in night vision, security, and industrial applications.
- X-ray Cameras: Utilized for medical imaging, security screening, and industrial inspection. Capture X-rays, which have shorter wavelengths than visible light.
- 3D Cameras: Capture depth information along with color. Used in computer vision, robotics, and augmented reality applications.
- Depth Cameras: Measure the distance of objects from the camera to create a depth map. Commonly used in computer vision, gesture recognition, and virtual reality.


These are just a few examples, and there are many specialized cameras designed for specific applications. Each type of camera serves a particular purpose, depending on the information required for a given task. In particular, we are going to take a look at the Depth cameras, in particular kinect, as it is a well known and stablished camera within the medical community for a variety of applications, like we have talked about before.

RGB cameras and depth cameras, such as the Kinect sensor, serve distinct purposes in imaging technology. While RGB cameras focus on capturing color information, depth cameras are designed to measure the distance of objects in a scene, providing a three-dimensional representation of the environment. The Kinect sensor, for instance, utilizes a combination of infrared sensors and a depth-sensing technology called time-of-flight to measure the time it takes for infrared light to travel to an object and back. This information is then used to create a depth map, representing the spatial layout of the scene.

One significant difference between RGB and depth cameras lies in their respective capabilities. RGB cameras excel in capturing detailed color information, making them suitable for applications like photography, video recording, and image analysis where color fidelity is essential. On the other hand, depth cameras are valuable in scenarios where understanding the spatial relationships and distances between objects is critical. This makes them ideal for applications like gesture recognition, virtual reality, and robotics, where depth perception plays a vital role.
