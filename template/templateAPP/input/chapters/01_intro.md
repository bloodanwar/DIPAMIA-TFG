## How back pain affects health
Health is a problem that never can escape us, whether we want it or not, we get sick from time to time, and illnesses are a main cause of discomfort in your day-to-day life, but for many people, it's not only a discomfort, many people have chronic ilneses that don't allow them to have a normal life, and they don't deserve it. As many experts see it two main causes of illness affect people in today's world, mental illness and back pain.

As Gordon Waddell talks about in his book "The back pain revolution", back pain is a pervasive and often debilitating condition that affects millions of people worldwide, transcending age, occupation, and lifestyle. As one of the most common reasons for seeking medical attention, back pain poses a significant challenge to the well-being and functionality of individuals across diverse demographics. This book delves into the multifaceted nature of back pain, exploring its possible causes, far-reaching implications, and the profound impact it has on the daily lives of those who grapple with this condition.

Understanding the root causes of back pain is crucial in addressing and managing this prevalent health issue. From musculoskeletal imbalances and poor posture to more complex conditions such as herniated discs and spinal deformities, the variety of factors contributing to back pain is vast. By unraveling these causes, we can better comprehend the intricate web of influences that contribute to the development and persistence of back pain, thereby paving the way for more targeted and effective interventions.

Beyond the physical discomfort it causes, back pain goes through various aspects of individuals' lives. It enters professional life, limiting work productivity and potentially limiting career advancement. Simple daily activities become annoying tasks, demolishing the quality of life for those fighting with persistent pain. Furthermore, the emotional toll of chronic back pain can lead to anxiety, depression, and a sense of helplessness, creating a cascading effect on mental well-being.

Posture stands as a cornerstone in the intricate puzzle of back pain. Poor posture places undue stress on the spine, its supporting structures, and surrounding muscles, often leading to discomfort and pain. Sedentary lifestyles, prolonged hours spent hunched over screens, or improper ergonomics contribute to the prevalence of poor posture. This misalignment, whether subtle or pronounced, can over time lead to imbalances in muscle strength and flexibility, setting the stage for chronic back issues.

The way individuals walk, known as *gait*, is another pivotal factor influencing back health. An abnormal gait pattern can trigger misalignments in the spine, impacting the distribution of forces throughout the body. For instance, an uneven gait or excessive pronation of the feet can lead to compensatory movements in the spine, potentially causing strain and pain, this is a very well know problem for those who have plain feet and the reason those people ned to have prosthetics to help their posture.

Occupational demands and lifestyle choices significantly contribute to poor posture and walking habits. Jobs that require prolonged sitting or repetitive movements may contribute to muscular imbalances and faulty posture. Similarly, carrying heavy loads, whether at work or in daily activities, can strain the back and alter gait patterns, further increasing the risk of developing or exacerbating back pain.

This project will explore not only the physiological aspects of back pain but also its broader implications on society. By researching this condition, we aim to help the development of comprehensive strategies for prevention, management, and treatment. Through an understanding and research of back pain, we can empower individuals, healthcare professionals, and policymakers to collaborate in mitigating its impact and creating a healthier, more resilient society.

## Mental issues and how they relate to posture

This project will take part in a bigger research article related also with the importance of mental ilness in society.

Mental illness poses a significant challenge to society, affecting people, families, and communities on various levels. Moreover, mental illness can disrupt social relationships and hinder effective communication, leading to social isolation and the destruction of a person's life from within itself. Depression, a common mental health disorder, affects millions of people globally, impairing their ability to function optimally in daily life. The repercussions of depression extend beyond individual suffering, where it can lead to harder and much worse consecuences. Even if it doesn't go too far it can hinder your life in a very hard way making you not be a "proper" person even limiting you to to a bed, as you dont have the strength to leave.

Alzheimer's disease, a form of dementia, is a particularly prevalent and devastating mental health condition. As populations age worldwide, the incidence of Alzheimer's continues to rise, placing immense emotional and financial strain on families. The progressive nature of the disease not only steal the cognitive abilities on the people who suffer it but also places a burden on the families and whoever is in charge of them. Personaly this has been a big issue in my family, where i've suffered several cases of alzheimer's disease and it's been hard to us as a family to deal with.

The societal impact of mental illness also manifests in stigmatization, discrimination, and inadequate access to mental health services. Stigma surrounding mental health issues can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, increasing the severity of conditions. Adressing mental health challenges on a societal level requires comprehensive strategies, including destigmatization, improved access to mental health resources, and increased awareness to help a supportive and inclusive environment for those affected by these conditions. Addressing mental health not only benefits individuals but also contributes to the overall well-being and productivity of society.

In the research this project takes part of, we aim to also stablish a link on posture and movement to the discovery and precention of mental health such as both we talked aboout, alzheimers and depression. There are articles that correlate mental health sympthomps to verval but also non verbal signs. Researchers have focused their attention on a visual and linguistic indications for assessing depression. This project introduces related work on facial features, audio features, body features, and Kinect-based rehabilitation training and detection methods in particular.

## Improving the medical field

Technology, particularly advancements in computer science, has played a crucial role in revolutionizing the medical field, enhancing patient care, and driving improvements in the healthcare sistem. One of the most notable contributions comes from the utilization of electronic health records, which have simplified the management and accessibility of patient information. EHRs enable doctors to access detailed and up-to-date patient records instantly, facilitating more informed decision-making and coordinated care across various medical departments. This not only improves the efficiency but also reduces medical errors wich lead to a better health care sistem overall.

Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications have significantly impacted medical diagnostics and treatment planning. Advanced algorithms can analyze vast amounts of medical data, such as imaging studies, genetic information, and patient histories, to identify patterns and provide decisions that may escape the human eye. In fields like radiology, AI algorithms have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in detecting abnormalities, expediting diagnoses, and contributing to earlier interventions. Additionally, personalized medicine has gained momentum through genomic research, leveraging computational methods to analyze individual genetic profiles and create treatment plans to the specific genetic makeup of each patient.

Telemedicine, another technological advancement fueled by computer science, has transformed healthcare accessibility. Using video consultations, remote monitoring, and digital communication, patients can receive medical advice and monitoring without the need for physical visits to hospitals. This has proven particularly important as of late, folowing the events of the global pandemic that hit us a couple of years ago, even tho other parts of the world had been using it prior to that. 

This project aims to tackle the previous points and merge them into one, alowing us the benefits of telemedicine and artificial intelligence in the aims of creating a new diagnostic method for the biggest health issues of today's world. This is the goal, helping society to overcome what we see as the problems of the future and the present, that make life worse for so many  people on this world.
