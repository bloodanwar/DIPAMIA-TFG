# Anexo 1 - Metodologia de trabajo Scrum.

Scrum is an agile project management framework that helps teams deliver high-value products. It emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and customer feedback. The process is organized into time-boxed iterations called sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks. Scrum includes roles like Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team, as well as specific events like Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.

This is an altered version of the scrum methodology since there are only two parties involved in this project, the developer and the product owner. Carlos will be the developer and Felix and David will take part as the product owners.
When adapting Scrum for a single developer and a single Product Owner, the structure can be simplified while maintaining key principles. 
Here's the modified version we are opting for:
- Roles:
  - Developer: This is the individual responsible for all aspects of the product's development, from design to implementation and testing. Carlos Rincón González
  - Product Owner (PO): This person represents the stakeholders, defines the features, and prioritizes the work to maximize the product's value. Felix Albertos and David Carneros
- Events:
  - Sprint Planning: At the beginning of each sprint (a development iteration), the developer and PO collaborate to plan the work for the upcoming sprint. These events will occur once every 2 to 4 weeks during the sprint meeting.
  - Daily Check-in: The developer has a brief daily check-in to review progress and plan the next steps. This is an opportunity to adjust plans based on feedback or changing priorities. This is not a necessary step and it's mostly used as a method of self-organization in the daily tasks of the developer
  - Sprint Review: At the end of each sprint, the developer presents the completed work to the PO. They discuss what was achieved and any adjustments needed for future sprints. Same as with the sprint planning, this will take part as part of the sprint meeting.
  - Sprint Retrospective: The developer reflects on the sprint, identifying what went well and what could be improved. This can be a brief self-assessment to enhance the development process. This will be a part of the sprint meeting as well.

- Artifacts:
  - Backlog: The Product Owner maintains a prioritized list of features and tasks, known as the backlog. The developer pulls items from the top of the backlog into each sprint.
  - The initial product backlog will consist of all the objectives set for the project in the beginning meeting. This objective will be stripped down into its crucial and more basic parts to be worked on and to develop a successful project

By simplifying the structure, a single developer can still benefit from Scrum's iterative and feedback-driven approach. The collaboration between the developer and product owner remains crucial for delivering valuable increments of the product.

For the management and monitoring of the project, we will make use of a tool called GitHubFor this workflow, we are going to use the tool within GitHub called Github projects. GitHub Projects is a collaborative project management tool designed to enhance the organization and tracking of software development projects on the GitHub platform. It provides a visual interface that allows teams to plan, track, and manage their work efficiently. GitHub Projects utilizes the concept of boards, where tasks are represented as cards that can be moved between customizable columns, such as "Product Backlog", "Sprint Backlog", "In Progress", and "Done". This flexibility makes it adaptable to various project management methodologies, including Agile and Kanban. 
Additionally, GitHub Projects integrates seamlessly with other GitHub features, such as code repositories and pull requests, providing a comprehensive ecosystem for collaborative software development, which is precisely the reason why we chose to use it, as we hosted our project on GitHub.

## Sprint 4 (05/12/2023  - 19/12/2023 )  - State of the art.

- **Sprint meeting**
  - We agreed that the introduction art needed more development and we set ourselves on the path to research more about it in the future.
  - At this point, it was time to start working on the state of the art.
  - Also, we had to establish the motivations and objectives more clearly and develop a clear explanation of them in the project memory.

- **Sprint Tasks**
  - **Tsk_31** Further explanation of the introduction **(1)**
  - **Tsk_32** Research of the state of the art **(9)**

- **Sprint Retrospective**
  - The points to iron out are the references, the orthography and use of the third person instead of the first person.
  - The sprint went well but i have to direct refference much more, even referencing every single example.

## Sprint 5 ( 19/12/2023 - 16/01/2024 )  - Holiday Season Improvements. 

- **Sprint meeting**
  - The previous sprint was successful in creating a beginning of a state of the art.

## Sprint 7 (  02/02/2024 - 23/02/2024 )  - Big steps into the code.

- **Sprint meeting**
  - we created a baseline code that extracts the data from the camera, we have to iterate and expand on this
  - we have to extract the data to csv in order to be processed
  - the code development has to continue by experimenting with the coordinates and seeing them change and what data we can extract from them

- **Sprint Tasks**
  - **Tsk_61** Data extraction for the x,y,z to csv **(7)**
  - **Tsk_62** Angle normalization of the coordinates **(9)** 
  - **Tsk_63** Dection of steps taken **(12)**


- **Sprint Retrospective**
  - Angle normalization of the coordinates turned out to be harder than expected and is not finished.
  - Step detection is nearly done but not finished. Needs to be finalized.
  - Spent a lot of time in code development but left aside the document and that is not good.
  - focused on a visual representation of the data which is not at all relevant for us.

## Sprint 8 ( 23/02/2024 - 08/03/2024 )  - Changes to the code and angles.

- **Sprint meeting**
  - have to fix the remaining problems on the document as they have been ignored for too long
  - the previous sprint was not very productive as the code took too much time and was way too complex
  - bring back to the beginning and start from scratch the code with a new focus
