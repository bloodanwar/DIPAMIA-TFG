# State of the art

To know what can be done regarding our interests, we must look at what has already been done so far, so we don't waste our time doing something already done by someone else and also so we can use that research as a base to further improve our understanding and our work. 
Because of this we are going to be looking at the state of the art on camera tecnologies, methods of stracting the data and different models of artificial intelligence.

## Cameras

As we mentioned in our objectives, we aim to make the 

Cameras come in various types, and they are not limited to capturing only RGB (Red, Green, Blue) information. Here are some types of cameras that go beyond RGB:

Infrared (IR) Cameras: Capture infrared light, which is beyond the visible spectrum. Used in night vision applications, thermal imaging, and scientific research.
Ultraviolet (UV) Cameras: Detect ultraviolet light, which is also outside the visible spectrum. Applied in scientific research, forensics, and some industrial processes.
Multispectral Cameras: Capture light in multiple bands across the electromagnetic spectrum. Useful in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and medical imaging.
Hyperspectral Cameras: Capture a large number of narrow and contiguous bands across the electromagnetic spectrum. Valuable in applications like remote sensing, agriculture, and material identification.
Thermal Infrared Cameras: Detect the heat emitted by objects. Commonly used in night vision, security, and industrial applications.
X-ray Cameras: Utilized for medical imaging, security screening, and industrial inspection. Capture X-rays, which have shorter wavelengths than visible light.
Gamma-ray Cameras: Used in scientific research and nuclear medicine to detect gamma rays. Typically employed for imaging in nuclear imaging techniques.
3D Cameras: Capture depth information along with color. Used in computer vision, robotics, and augmented reality applications.
Polarized Cameras: Detect polarized light. Applied in materials science, stress analysis, and glare reduction.
Depth Cameras: Measure the distance of objects from the camera to create a depth map. Commonly used in computer vision, gesture recognition, and virtual reality.


These are just a few examples, and there are many specialized cameras designed for specific applications. Each type of camera serves a particular purpose, depending on the information required for a given task.
